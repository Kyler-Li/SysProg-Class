Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.
To make me sufficent in C, serve as a crux for landing me in a software engineering position, 
and program my own projects that is not usually application programming. Get me out of my comfort zone asap so that
I won't feel super uncomfortable down the line. Adding onto that, perhaps being sufficient in Linux may help me.

Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).
Not being able to get a C minimum or receiving a failing/poor grade. From what I've heard from my friend, this course
is challenging since it's considered a challenging course some courses do require a C min in order to take advanced CS courses.
